			<b>Kuakata</b> is known for its picturesque landscape beauty of panoramic beach, clear blue sky, the tides of the bay bashing on the shore and its mangrove forest. The beach is about 30 kilometers in length, 6 kilometers in breadth and situated at the Lotachapli Union, Kolapara Thana, Patuakhali District. It's unique as there are no other beaches in Bangladesh where you can witness both sunrise and sunset. Jhaubon (Jhau forest) is an exquisite place in Kuakata which is close to the beach.
			<br><p>
			Jhau forest is established as a result of initiative taken by government. You can reach Jhaubon by walking from the beach. Jhaubon is covered by Jhau and coconut trees. It's a wonderful place for observing the sunrise. An Eco Park exists at Jhaubon area which is a fascinating place for picnic or junket. To the east of Jhau forest, there is Gangamati Reserved Forest. So you should visit both Jhaubon and Gangamati Reserved Forest at the same time. Jhaubon is a wonderful place to calm down & very well-acquainted for visitors. Each year, many tourists come here for pleasure......</p></br>

			<b>Cox's Bazar</b> is a District under Chittagong Division, which is famous for its longest unbroken sandy sea beach. It is located 150 km south of the industrial port- Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is considered as having the longest sea beach in the world, with a total of 121 kilometer long. The name Cox's Bazar was derived from its founder, Captain Cox. He founded the very attractive beach in 1798. Then the Cox's Bazar beach started only as a small port and health resort.<br>

			Though the beach is considered to be the longest beach in the world, it has been the least crowded among the other beaches. Here, visitors can enjoy the relaxing breeze of the Bay of Bengal Sea and the peacefulness of the place. The Cox's bazar beach certainly has the finest leisure it can offer to each of its visitors. People can take a timely stroll along the lengthened stretch of the beach and enjoy the view of the amazing seascape. Visitors can also enjoy water sport activities like scuba diving, surfing, and try some boat rides......</p><br>

			Satkhira region is mainly famous for the <b>Sundarbans</b>. Sundarbans is most large single block of tidal mangrove forest in the world. It lies between the vast Bay of Bengal Ocean and rivers of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, it spreads across Bangladesh and West Bengal in India. The waters of these rivers mix with the ocean water and so in this part of their flow the rivers are brackish or saline. Water covers the forest-islands twice a day during high tide. <br>
			It is considered a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The forest is mostly popular for incredible plants and wildlife. Trees having roots can breathe directly from the air. There are numerous species and it is mostly famous for Royal Bengal tiger. The forest safeguards people of north from cyclones and tsunami waves. Previously, the islanders were allowed to go into the forest to collect firewood, honey, crab and fish but now these activities have been banned by the governments of both Bangladesh and West Bengal......
